Winter%%Hello%Ottawa%artFiles/Pastel Winter.png%As the weather warms up I began reminicing on the beautiful winters of my childhood. Growing up in Ottawa I remember those frosty early mornings where this blanket of while would cover everything the eye could see, leaving this pastelish hue on everything the light touched. I'll always remember those days with a deep fondness. The weather might've been oh so cold but I was warmed by the depths of my own heart.
